# Mandelbrot Explorer
This is a variation of my exploration of Python, and here, pulling in math and plotting functions, Instead of using Flask to render the webpage, I am trying out Streamlit, which is a Python hosting service that provides its own framework to render the webpage.

At least for the free, "Community" free hosting, this is very limited and at least in this initial version, is simply a super basic Mandelbrot "explorer" with totally manual inputs.  There are no Zoom In/Out and Pan buttons, which I put into the HTML template framework on the original Explorer. Also gone, at least for now, are the presets.

## Code Structure
Due to the nature of Streamlit, and this being my very first use of it, this is simply the core Python Mandelbrot computational code, and nothing else.
